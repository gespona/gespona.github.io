## Inmoov Shoulder

I can't remember how many times I mounted and dismounted the shoulder mechanism. This weekend I did another test and failed again.

Definetly seems the servo has not enough torque and get blocked. I reviewed many times and servo join is not touching the near wall, so not getting block just because some friction.

I suspect the servo got damaged when I was extracting the potentiometer. So next step is going to prepare a new servo. That's going to bring me the opportunity to prepare another "behind the scenes" for Patreon.
