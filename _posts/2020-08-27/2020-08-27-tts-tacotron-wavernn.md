During last weeks I've been playing with TTS (Text-To-Speech) ... looking for Bit Robot (Inmoov) voice. I trained WaveRNN from scratch using LJSpeech dataset and after I trained Tacotron and Forward-Tacotron. It took some GPU-days and even it's my first tests, results are pretty good. Now training bit more to use with MelGAN.

You can find Forward-Tacotron code [here](https://github.com/as-ideas/ForwardTacotron)

Soon I will publish "behind the scenes" post on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/gerardespona) about how to setup and train the system and provide access to my fork with trained models and some fixes because some requirements are broken. So don't forget to check.
