## Shoulder

Definetly the most complex part until now. After all the issues I found few months ago, I decided to recalibrate the printer and reprint and build the shoulder again.
Works much better, but still not clear if the gear is getting blocked with the support or the servo motor has not enough power (damaged).
I'm preparing a new test after polishing the gear part. If not working I will prepare a new servo motor.
