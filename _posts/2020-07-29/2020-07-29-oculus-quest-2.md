## Oculus Quest 2 / S / Pro / .... ?

Yes ... not much info beside some photos leaked .. but everyone seems excited with the idea of launching new Oculus Quest Device.

Big discussions about if there is support for IPD adjustment and how: Software adjustment ?, Lens position to fix on two main setups ?

At the end not much, some sources pointing to September .. so let's update the post when there is an official announcement.
