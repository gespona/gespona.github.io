## Pool Table

After watching several examples mapping real home spaces in VR, I was not able to avoid play around the concept. In this case who never wanted to have a life-size pool table at home?

Probably like me, you don't have space but living room table has similar size, so I pick up a few nice pool tables from Unity Asset Store and did some tricks with initial camera position to sync my living room table with virtual pool table.

If you like playing pool, you'll agree that most of the experience relay when you support yourself on the pool table and really improves a lot of the VR experience. Maybe the difficult part as you can see in the video is to tweak the two hand controllers to simulate how we pick and play with the pool stick and probably tweak a bit the physics on the table.

It's a good candidate to work bit more in depth as standalone project.
