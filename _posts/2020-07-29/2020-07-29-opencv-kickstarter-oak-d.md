## Depth Camera

It's time to work on camera system for Inmoov robot. On the website the standard setup is to use Kinect V2 as depth sensor and standard cameras located at eye system.

For several reasons I decided to go outside this setup and give a try to Intel RealSense D435 meanwhile Azure Kinect Dev Kit is available for shipping in Spain.

At the time I'm writing this post, OpenCV launched a kickstarter campaign about new camera and depth camera ... what a nice timing ! so decided to back the project with the OAK-D (depth camera). Specs looks nice with 4K camera and small form factor. The only thing is shipping by Dec 2020 .. so I need to wait a bit to play around.
