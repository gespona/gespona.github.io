description: Who never wanted to develop (small) video game? motion capture system? I found Unity a great platform. I published some small mobile video games and currently focused on 3D/VR development. On the other hand ML-Agents is great platform to play around Reinforcement Learning and was a pleasure to participate on Obstacle Tower Challenge (2019). Currently I'm using ML-Agents to create virtual environments for training robots and transfer to real world (sim2real)
