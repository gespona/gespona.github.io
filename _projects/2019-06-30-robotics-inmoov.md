Inmoov is Open Source 3D Printed life-size humanoid

I'm following this project for a long time now and on July 2019 I decided to get my first 3D Printer (AnyCubic Mega-S)

Definetly it's a project to push you outside your comfort zone. It involves building skills, electronics and programming knowledge and lot of time and patience ;)
