subtitle: 'Combine input sources with Reinforcement Learning and other Machine Learning'
date: 2019-06-30 09:30:00
description: I'm developing a framework to combine input sources and use Reinforcement Learning to provide the ability of interact, learn and execute tasks in a very similar way we interact humans. Interaction is the basis of how we learn and (co)-operate in real world. This project unifies large set of areas of interest such as Robotics, HCI, 3D Printing, Deep Learning/RL, Learning transfer from virtual environments (Unity3D / XR), Computer Vision and Speech/NLP.
