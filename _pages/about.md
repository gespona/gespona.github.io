## Summary

I've been working on several managing roles on startup companies for 10+ years now with 20+ years as BsC Computer Eng. experience on Soft dev, very hands-on. As CTO usually overlapping with other roles like VP Eng / Eng Manager. Main responsibility with Dev Team is provide best working environment taking care of methodology (scrum), career plans/mentoring, 1:1s, providing support on technical leadership. 3 years in charge of AWS Infrastructure. On the other hand I'm bridge with Product and Business. I consider myself very empathic, positive, resilient and think this is giving me the right skills to work easily with the rest of the company and align efforts to achieve the same goals.

I'm enthusiastic of technological innovation and know by experience the only way to achieve great goals is sharing values and work as a team.

I have large experience in startup ecosystem and mobile sector companies and as an engineer I have high self-learning capacity and complex system analysis skills.
